# üöÄ How to Run the Improved Stock Prediction System

## üìã Prerequisites

### 1. Install Dependencies
First, install all required packages:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

**Important**: If you encounter issues with `talib-binary`, try:
```bash
pip install TA-Lib
```

### 2. Verify Installation
Test that all packages are installed correctly:
```bash
python -c "import pandas, numpy, sklearn, xgboost, lightgbm, talib; print('‚úÖ All packages installed successfully!')"
```

## üéØ Running Options

### Option 1: Simple Prediction (Recommended for Quick Results)
Run the simple prediction system for reliable, fast results:

```bash
python simple_prediction_runner.py
```

This will:
- Ask you for a stock ticker (e.g., RELIANCE, AAPL, TCS)
- Ask for prediction days (default: 5)
- Use basic, reliable models (Random Forest + Linear Regression)
- Display clear predictions with confidence intervals
- Provide trading recommendations
- **Fast and reliable** - no complex features that can cause errors

### Option 2: Advanced Prediction (For Advanced Users)
Run the comprehensive prediction system with advanced features:

```bash
python comprehensive_prediction_runner.py
```

This will:
- Ask you for a stock ticker (e.g., RELIANCE, AAPL, TCS)
- Ask for prediction days (default: 5)
- Use 8 advanced machine learning models
- Include 50+ technical indicators and features
- Display comprehensive results with confidence intervals
- Save detailed reports
- **More sophisticated** but may take longer and require more computational resources

### Option 3: Direct Function Call
If you want to run it programmatically:

```python
# Simple prediction
from simple_prediction_runner import run_simple_prediction
success = run_simple_prediction("RELIANCE", days_ahead=5)

# Advanced prediction
from comprehensive_prediction_runner import run_comprehensive_prediction
success = run_comprehensive_prediction("RELIANCE", days_ahead=5)
```

### Option 4: Individual Components
Run specific components separately:

```python
# Simple prediction engine
from simple_prediction_runner import SimplePredictionEngine
engine = SimplePredictionEngine("RELIANCE")
df = engine.load_and_prepare_data()
X, y = engine.prepare_features(df)
engine.train_simple_models(X, y)
predictions, multi_day = engine.generate_predictions(X, 5)

# Advanced prediction engine
from improved_prediction_engine import ImprovedPredictionEngine
engine = ImprovedPredictionEngine("RELIANCE")
df = engine.load_and_prepare_data()
X, y = engine.prepare_features(df)
engine.train_advanced_models(X, y)
predictions, multi_day = engine.generate_predictions(X, 5)
```

## üìä What You'll Get

### 1. Advanced Model Predictions
- **8 Machine Learning Models**: Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, XGBoost, LightGBM, SVR, Ridge, Lasso, MLP
- **Ensemble Prediction**: Weighted average of all models
- **Individual Model Results**: See how each model performs

### 2. Confidence Analysis
- **68% and 95% Confidence Intervals**: Statistical confidence bands
- **Model Agreement Score**: How much the models agree
- **Prediction Uncertainty**: Quantified uncertainty

### 3. Trading Signals
- **Clear Recommendations**: STRONG_BUY, BUY, HOLD, SELL, STRONG_SELL
- **Signal Strength**: Quantitative strength measurement
- **Expected Returns**: Percentage change predictions

### 4. Risk Assessment
- **Risk Levels**: LOW, MEDIUM, HIGH based on volatility
- **Stop Loss/Take Profit**: Automated level calculation
- **Position Sizing**: Risk-adjusted recommendations

### 5. Multi-Day Forecasts
- **Day-by-Day Predictions**: Up to 10 days ahead
- **Trend Analysis**: Direction and magnitude
- **Confidence Decay**: Decreasing confidence over time

## üìÅ Output Files

After running, you'll find these files in the `data/` folder:

1. **`{TICKER}_comprehensive_prediction_report.csv`**: Main prediction results
2. **`{TICKER}_enhanced_strategy_report.csv`**: Strategy analysis
3. **`{TICKER}_detailed_results.pkl`**: Detailed results (for programmatic access)

## üîß Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:

1. **"Enhanced data file not found"**
   - Solution: First run the unified pipeline to generate data:
   ```bash
   python unified_analysis_pipeline.py
   ```

2. **"Module not found" errors**
   - Solution: Install missing packages:
   ```bash
   pip install xgboost lightgbm TA-Lib
   ```

3. **"TA-Lib installation failed"**
   - Solution: Use conda or download pre-built wheels:
   ```bash
   conda install -c conda-forge ta-lib
   ```

4. **"Memory error"**
   - Solution: Reduce the number of features or use a smaller dataset

### Performance Tips:

1. **First Run**: Will be slower as it trains new models
2. **Subsequent Runs**: Much faster as it loads pre-trained models
3. **GPU Usage**: Uncomment GPU support in requirements.txt if available

## üéØ Example Usage

### For Indian Stocks:
```bash
python comprehensive_prediction_runner.py
# Enter: RELIANCE
# Enter: 5
```

### For US Stocks:
```bash
python comprehensive_prediction_runner.py
# Enter: AAPL
# Enter: 3
```

### For Quick Testing:
```bash
python run_prediction_only.py
# This runs a simplified version for quick results
```
