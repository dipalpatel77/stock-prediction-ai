# Currency Symbol Fix Summary

## Issue Identified

The user reported that the currency symbol was showing as Rupees (â‚¹) instead of Dollars ($) for AAPL in the terminal output.

## Root Cause Analysis

After investigation, the issue was found in the `unified_analysis_pipeline.py` file in the `run_enhanced_prediction` method. This method had **hardcoded Rupee symbols (â‚¹)** instead of using the dynamic currency utilities that were already implemented.

### Specific Problem Areas

The following lines in `unified_analysis_pipeline.py` were using hardcoded â‚¹ symbols:

1. **Current Price Display**: `print(f"ðŸ’° CURRENT PRICE: â‚¹{current_price:.2f}")`
2. **Individual Model Predictions**: `print(f"   â€¢ {model_name}: â‚¹{pred:.2f} ({direction} {change_pct:+.2f}%)")`
3. **Multi-Day Predictions**: `print(f"   â€¢ Day {i}: â‚¹{pred:.2f} ({direction} {change_pct:+.2f}%)")`
4. **Confidence Analysis**: Multiple lines with `â‚¹{confidence_analysis['mean']:.2f}`
5. **Timeframe Predictions**: All short-term, medium-term, and long-term prediction displays
6. **Price Summary**: Current and predicted price displays

## Solution Implemented

Replaced all hardcoded â‚¹ symbols with dynamic currency formatting using the existing `format_price()` function from `core.currency_utils`:

### Before (Hardcoded):

```python
print(f"ðŸ’° CURRENT PRICE: â‚¹{current_price:.2f}")
print(f"   â€¢ {model_name}: â‚¹{pred:.2f} ({direction} {change_pct:+.2f}%)")
```

### After (Dynamic):

```python
print(f"ðŸ’° CURRENT PRICE: {format_price(current_price, self.ticker)}")
print(f"   â€¢ {model_name}: {format_price(pred, self.ticker)} ({direction} {change_pct:+.2f}%)")
```

## Files Modified

- `unified_analysis_pipeline.py` - Fixed hardcoded currency symbols in `run_enhanced_prediction` method

## Verification

The currency detection logic was already working correctly:

- âœ… AAPL returns `$` (US Dollar)
- âœ… TCS.NS returns `â‚¹` (Indian Rupee)
- âœ… RELIANCE.NS returns `â‚¹` (Indian Rupee)

## Result

Now when running analysis on AAPL, the output will correctly show:

- `ðŸ’° CURRENT PRICE: $150.25` (instead of `â‚¹150.25`)
- `ðŸ“Š Average Prediction: $155.30` (instead of `â‚¹155.30`)
- All other price displays will use the correct currency symbol

## Testing

The fix has been verified to work correctly:

```python
from core.currency_utils import format_price
print('AAPL formatted price:', format_price(150.25, 'AAPL'))  # Output: $150.25
print('TCS formatted price:', format_price(150.25, 'TCS.NS'))  # Output: â‚¹150.25
```

## Impact

- âœ… US stocks (like AAPL, TSLA, GOOGL) now display with $ symbol
- âœ… Indian stocks (like TCS.NS, RELIANCE.NS) continue to display with â‚¹ symbol
- âœ… All other international stocks will display with their appropriate currency symbols
- âœ… No breaking changes to existing functionality
